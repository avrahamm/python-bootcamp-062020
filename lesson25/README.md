My implementation of Tic Tao starts at Lesson 24 code.
I tried to save good things were there.
Also I used Tic Tao webinar code and ideas.
I would say the main difference I put a board object
into GameManager. I made the code more OOP style.
GameManager provides Board object to
players when necessary.

Input format errors are served with error message
and loop starts again.
It is possible to play with Human or AI players,
1 or 2 of each.
Also it is possible to play more that one time,
and to see score at the end of each game.

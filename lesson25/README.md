My implementation of Tic Tao starts at Lesson 24 code.</br>
I tried to save good things were there.</br>
Also I used Tic Tao webinar code and ideas.</br>
I would say the main difference I put a board object</br>
into GameManager. I made the code more OOP style.</br>
GameManager provides Board object to</br>
players when necessary.</br>

Input format errors are served with error message</br>
and loop starts again.</br>
It is possible to play with Human or AI players,</br>
1 or 2 of each.</br>
Also it is possible to play more that one time,</br>
and to see score at the end of each game.</br>

Currently, tests do not work so you can ignore test folder.
